### Port

- There are different type of webservers
  - NGINX
  - Apache
  - Kong
  - Light HTTP
  - IIS
  - HTTP Proxy

### Licenence in Software Development

- There are different types of licence which are allows user of the software to distribute, modify or otherwise use software for any purpose, as long as the user complies with the licence terms.
