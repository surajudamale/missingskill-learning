# **LINUX**

#### Basic Information about Linux Environment

- Linux is a free, open-source operating system. All of Digital Ocean’s offered operating systems are Linux distributions.
- Linux has been under active development since 1991. It has evolved to be versatile and is used all over the world, from web servers to cellphones.
- Digital Ocean offers Linux distributions on droplets because Linux is free and easy to use.
- However, newcomers to Linux may find it difficult to approach the structure of an unfamiliar operating system.
  This guide gently introduces key terminal skills and equips newcomers to learn more about Linux.

#### The Terminal
